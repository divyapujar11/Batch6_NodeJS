fs module:
* it is built-in module called file system
* All file system operations can have synchronous and asynchronous forms depending upon user requirements
* One peculiar thing about the fs module is that all the methods are asynchronous by default, but they can also work synchronously by appending Sync
    eg: readFile() - asynchronous
        readFileSync() - synchronous
        writeFile() - asynchronous
        writeFileSync() - synchronous

readFileSync() - reads the file completely and move to next code, which is blocking code i,e interrupts the execution of further code
readFile() reads the file in the end without blocking the further code execution i,e this is non-blocking code
