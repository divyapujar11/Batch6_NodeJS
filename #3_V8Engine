V8 engine:
* V8 engine is google's opensource high-performance js engine, written in c++ and used in google chrome
* V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any c++ application
* V8 engine converts JS code into machine code

JavaScript engine:
* computer do not understand JS code
* A JS engine takes JS and converts it into something which machine can understand
          
          JavaScript to Machine Code:
             |      JS           |
             |     C++           |
             |  Assembly Language|
             |  Machine code     |

* Node.js is written in c++
* at the heart of node.js is the v8 engine
* the v8 engine converts js into machine code

                Node.js with V8:
        |             JS              |
        |c++|       Node.js        |V8|
        |        Machine Code         |

* when js code is run through node.js, the code is passed to v8 and v8 converts the c++ code to machine code
